# driving test management system with C# 
This project was done by **Ehud Gershony** & **Yishai Badichi** (@badishay), undergraduate students in software engineering as part of the "Mini project of Windows systems .NET WPF" course at the Lev Academic Center.</br>
**Moderator:** Mr. Roi David.
## Description
The project was designed to improve the driving test system using advanced tools.
The system will allow the student to register for the test at the venue and at their convenience, the examiner will be able to update his or her hours of work.
The system will be run transparently so that a student will receive a grade on the parameters being tested and the overall grade will be automated by the system.
